A JavaScript practice assignment to create a rock-paper-scissors game. </br>

Live demo: https://oto-tuul.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/ </br>

Skills I've practiced on this project:
Writing JavaScript functions for a random number generator, a round of rock-paper-scissors game and keeping score, including let, if, switch statements, ternary operators, prompts and console logging.
Using evenListeners run the game function on button clicks.
Using DOM manipulation to output game results as HTML paragraphs.
